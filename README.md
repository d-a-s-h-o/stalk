# Stalk | Chat with other devs over SSH in your Terminal

***

Where are the devs at? They're talking via SSH - or "Stalking"!

Stalk is a custom SSH server that takes you to a chat instead of a shell prompt. Because there's SSH apps on all platforms (even on phones) you can connect to Talk on any device!

## Usage

Try it out:

```sh
ssh talk.dasho.dev
```

If it's your first time logging in, you can choose your display name with the SSH username. For example, if you want to be called "curious", you can run:
```sh
ssh curious@talk.dasho.dev
```
If you want to change your display name after the first login, you should use the `nick` command.


If you're under a firewall, you can still join on port 443:
```sh
ssh talk.dasho.dev -p 443
```

If you add this to `~/.ssh/config`:
```ssh
Host talk
    HostName talk.dasho.dev
```

You'll be able to join with just:
```sh
ssh talk
```

Feel free to make a [new issue](https://github.com/d-a-s-h-o/stalk/issues) if something doesn't work.

### Want to host your own instance?

Quick start:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/d-a-s-h-o/stalk && cd stalk
go install # or build, if you want to keep things in the pwd
ssh-keygen -qN '' -f talk-sshkey # new ssh host key for the server
talk # run! the default config is used & written automatically
```
These commands download, build, setup and run a Talk server listening on port 2222, the default port (change by setting `$PORT`).

Check out the [Admin's Manual](Admin's%20Manual.md) for complete self-host documentation!

### Permission denied?

Talk uses public keys to identify users. If you are denied access: `foo@talk.dasho.dev: Permission denied (publickey)` try logging in on port 443, which does not require a key, using `ssh talk.dasho.dev -p 443`.

This error may happen because you do not have an SSH key pair. Generate one with the command `ssh-keygen` if this is the case. (you can usually check if you have a key pair by making sure a file of this form: `~/.ssh/id_*` exists)

### Help

```text
Welcome to Talk! Talk is a chat over SSH: github.com/d-a-s-h-o/talk
Because there's SSH apps on all platforms, even on mobile, you can join from anywhere.

Run `cmds` to see a list of commands.

Interesting features:
â€¢ Rooms! Run cd to see all rooms and use cd #foo to join a new room.
â€¢ Markdown support! Tables, headers, italics and everything. Just use \n in place of newlines.
â€¢ Code syntax highlighting. Use Markdown fences to send code. Run eg-code to see an example.
â€¢ Direct messages! Send a quick DM using =user <msg> or stay in DMs by running cd @user.
â€¢ Timezone support, use tz Continent/City to set your timezone.
â€¢ Built in Tic Tac Toe and Hangman! Run tic or hang <word> to start new games.
â€¢ Emoji replacements! :rocket: => ðŸš€  (like on Slack and Discord)

For replacing newlines, I often use bulkseotools.com/add-remove-line-breaks.php.

## Integrations
See the [Admin's Manual](Admin's%20Manual.md) for more info.

Talk has a plugin API you can use to integrate your own services: [documentation](plugin/README.md). Feel free to add a plugin to the main instance. Just ask for a token on the server.
